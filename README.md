### how to define variables
to define variables you need to write "where" after the calculation and there you put the variable and then its value
if you have more than one variable separate them by a semicolon ";"<br/>
<p style="margin: 5px"></p>
example:<br/>
3*ω where ω = 5 -> 15<br/>
9*a+2*b where a = 10; b = 5 -> 100<br/>
<p style="margin: 5px"></p>
you can put any letter(or symbol) you want for example:<br/>
3*∫ where ∫=3 -> 9
<p style="margin: 5px"></p>
you can also put words for example:<br/>
rudolph + 10 where rudolph = 5 -> 15

## constants that are supported: <br />
